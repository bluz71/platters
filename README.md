Platters
========

About
-----
This application, Platters, is an example web application developed using the
[Ruby on Rails web framework](http://rubyonrails.org) and associated technologies.

The Platters application is my complete album collection converted into a
database-backed web application with optional user registration, log in and
commenting components.

Platters is primarily a server-side application with sprinkles of JavaScript
(Turbolinks, jQuery, unobtrusive jQuery and CofeeScript). Note, using a
client-side JavaScript framework, such as Ember.js or React, was ruled out due
to complexity for such a small application such as this.

Miscellaneous application features
----------------------------------
  * #### Busy submission buttons
    All form submission buttons use the Rails Unobtrusive JavaScript (UJS)
    `data-disable-with` functionality to disable, and display a spinner icon,
    whilst a submitted form is being processed.

  * #### Client-side form validations
    Certain form elements, such as Artist name and Album title, are validated
    client side for blankness in addition to traditional server-side
    validation.

  * #### Turbolinks progress bar
    This Rails application uses Turbolinks for performant in-app page to page
    navigation. The Turbolinks progress bar has been enabled to provide visual
    feedback during such page navigation.

  * #### Turbolinks transition cache
    Load Turbolinks visited in-app pages from the internal transition cache.
    This will result in near instant page loads, with later automatic page
    refresh if page changes have occurred.

  * #### PostgreSQL text search
    Artist and Album search both use the PostgreSQL `@@` text search operator
    which provides support for: English dictionary stemming, multi-word search,
    stop words, and fuzzy text search for misspellings.

Why Rails?
----------
Ruby on Rails was chosen early on, from a host of possible web development
choices, due to the following appealing factors:

  * Developer happiness and enjoyment.
  * Unix based tooling, development and hosting.
  * Active communities, both locally and abroad.
  * Future employment possibilities.
  * Gateway to interesting technologies such as Elixir and Phoenix.
