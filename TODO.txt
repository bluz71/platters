- Gems:
    - Figaro for SECRETS management, clear out secrets.yml and generate a new
      SECRET_KEY_BASE. Run "rake secret". See:
        http://grog.brooksmason.com/rails/4.1/2014/10/24/rails4.1_heroku_figaro.html
    - friendly_id for Artist & Album show pages.
        No Artist or Album uses underscores in name/title.
        No Artist or Album uses double hypen in name/title.

        Hence for Artists just replace space with underscore:
          Foo_Bars
        For Albums use Album--Album:
          Foo_Bars--Greatest_Hits

    - make sure nginx is using Unix Domain Sockets when communicating with
      Puma, this will be much faster than using the default TCP option.
