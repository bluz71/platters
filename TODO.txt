- Replace SQLite with Postgres
    - Then add "rack-mini-profiler" gem
    - Convert LIKE query to @@ (see Railscasts episode 343)

- Setup Redis, this will be for fragment cache, sidekiq and rack-attack

- Setup Fragment Cache, use in-memory store (for artists/albums and side-bar):
    - config.cache_store = :memory_store, { size: 64.megabytes }
       prefer Redis

  reference them from seeds.rb. See these topics for hints:

        Faker::Company.bs.capitalize
        Faker::Hacker.say_something_smart
        Faker::Hipster.paragraph
        Faker::StarWars.quote

    - invisible_captcha gem for user registration (protect against bots)

- Use Mina for deployment.

- Deployment:
    - make sure nginx is using Unix Domain Sockets when communicating with
      Puma, this will be much faster than using the default TCP option.
