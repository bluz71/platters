- Upgrade from Turbolinks 2.5 to Turbolinks 5.
  Update init.coffee, delete Turbolinks stuff (those options are now enabled by default).
  Change "page:change" to "turbolinks:load"
  Change style in platters.scss from:
      html.turbolinks-progress-bar::before {
        background-color: $green-yeti !important;
      }
    to:
      .turbolinks-progress-bar {
        height: 5px;
        background-color: $green-yeti;
      }
  Home page: https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks

  Album randomize has bad cache behaviour, it is best to somehow not have that
  page be added to the Turbolinks cache: https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks#opting-out-of-caching

    - make sure nginx is using Unix Domain Sockets when communicating with
      Puma, this will be much faster than using the default TCP option.
